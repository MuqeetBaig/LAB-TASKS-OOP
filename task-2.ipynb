    "__init__ (Initialization):\n",
    "__init__ is like the setup stage when someone new joins a team. When a new object is created, __init__ gets called to give that object all the necessary details it needs—like its name, age, or other starting values. It’s the first step to get the object ready to do its job.\n",
